This is the source code for the fan site [Almost-Dead.net].
(It is not officially associated with the band [Joe Russo's Almost Dead].)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The website uses the [Gatsby] framework (v3).


## Documentation

Documentation is in Markdown files throughout the repository.

The task `npm run docs` will start a local webserver with a nice UX for browsing and searching, powered by [hads].

If you're reading this in the docs viewer, there is a search bar at the top of the page, and below is an index of all the files:

[[index]]


## Development

Run the app in the development mode:

    $ npm run dev

Open `http://localhost:8000` to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Deploy

Build the app for production, and deploy to GitHub Pages:

    $ npm run deploy:prod


## Tests

Tests are written using the integration framework [Cypress].

More info can be found in [the README in the `cypress` directory](./cypress/README.md).
