# CSV files

This directory contains the data source for the [Gatsby] powered site.

The `/gatsby-config.js` file defines sources using the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin.
The `/gatsby-node.js` file defines a GraphQL schema for those sources, which is then used as the context for the React components.

Each file is a sheet from a Google doc, and roughly corresponds to a table in a relational database.
